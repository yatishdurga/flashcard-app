      {question: "Explain the concept of supervised learning and how it is used in data science?",
        answer: "Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data, meaning that each training example has a corresponding label or outcome. For example, in spam detection, the training data consists of emails and their labels (spam or not spam). The model learns patterns to predict the labelThe model learns patterns to predict the labelThe model learns patterns to predict the labelThe model learns patterns to predict the labelThe model learns patterns to predict the labelThe model learns patterns to predict the labelThe model learns patterns to predict the labelThe model learns patterns to predict the labelThe model learns patterns to predict the labelThe model learns patterns to predict the labelThe model learns patterns to predict the labelThe model learns patterns to predict the labelThe model learns patterns to predict the labelThe model learns patterns to predict the labelThe model learns patterns to predict the labelThe model learns patterns to predict the labelThe model learns patterns to predict the labelThe model learns patterns to predict the labelThe model learns patterns to predict the labelThe model learns patterns to predict the labelThe model learns patterns to predict the labelThe model learns patterns to predict the labelThe model learns patterns to predict the labelThe model learns patterns to predict the labelThe model learns patterns to predict the labelThe model learns patterns to predict the labelThe model learns patterns to predict the labelThe model learns patterns to predict the labelThe model learns patterns to predict the labelThe model learns patterns to predict the labelThe model learns patterns to predict the labelThe model learns patterns to predict the labelThe model learns patterns to predict the labelThe model learns patterns to predict the labelThe model learns patterns to predict the labelThe model learns patterns to predict the labelThe model learns patterns to predict the labelThe model learns patterns to predict the labelThe model learns patterns to predict the labelThe model learns patterns to predict the labelThe model learns patterns to predict the labelThe model learns patterns to predict the labelThe model learns patterns to predict the labelThe model learns patterns to predict the labelThe model learns patterns to predict the labelThe model learns patterns to predict the labelThe model learns patterns to predict the label for unseen data.",

        {question: "How does cross-validation help in evaluating machine learning models?",
      answer: "Cross-validation involves splitting the dataset into multiple folds and training the model on some folds while testing it on the remaining. This process is repeated several times to ensure the model's performance is consistent and not dependent on a single train-test split.",
